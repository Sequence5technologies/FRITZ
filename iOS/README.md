## Examples for iOS

**Vision API: Prebuilt models that you can simply drop into your apps:**

- [Image Segmentation](https://www.fritz.ai/features/image-segmentation.html): Create pixel level masks of different objects in a scene.
- [Image Labeling](https://www.fritz.ai/features/image-labeling.html): Classify different objects in an video or image.
- [Pose Estimation](https://www.fritz.ai/features/pose-estimation.html): Identify and track a person's body position.
- [Object Detection](https://www.fritz.ai/features/object-detection.html): Detect multiple objects and track their location.
- [Style Transfer](https://www.fritz.ai/features/style-transfer.html): Transform photos and videos into artistic masterpieces.

**Custom Models: Deploy, Monitor, and Update your own models:**

We currently support Core ML for iOS.

- [Analytics and Monitoring](https://www.fritz.ai/features/analytics-monitoring.html): Monitor machine learning models running on-device with Fritz.
- [Model Management](https://www.fritz.ai/features/model-management.html): Iterate on your ML models over-the-air, without having to release your app.
- [Model Protection](https://www.fritz.ai/features/model-protection.html): Use model protection to keep models from being tampered-with or stolen.
